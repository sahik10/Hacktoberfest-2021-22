Import the re module for regular expression.
Open the file using the open() function.
Read all the lines in the file and store them in a list.
Declare the patter for IP addresses. The regex pattern is : 
 
r'(\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})'
For every element of the list search for the patter using the search() function, store the IP addresses in a list.
Display the list containing the IP addresses.



# importing the module
import re

# opening and reading the file
with open('C:/Users/user/Desktop/New Text Document.txt') as fh:
fstring = fh.readlines()

# declaring the regex pattern for IP addresses
pattern = re.compile(r'(\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})')

# initializing the list object
lst=[]

# extracting the IP addresses
for line in fstring:
lst.append(pattern.search(line)[0])

# displaying the extracted IP addresses
print(lst)
